One of the most common problems in digital photography is low resolution. Maybe you cropped a photo too much, or you have an old image from a 2010 smartphone. Traditional resizing makes these images pixelated and blurry. AI Upscaling solves this.

## What is AI Upscaling?

Unlike standard resizing (which just stretches pixels), AI Upscaling uses machine learning models trained on millions of images to "guess" and reconstruct the missing details. It literally adds new pixels to the image that look natural, resulting in sharp edges and clear textures.

## When should you upscale?

*   **Printing:** If your image is too small to print on a poster or canvas.
*   **Restoration:** Fixing old, grainy family photos.
*   **Web Assets:** Improving the quality of product images for your store.
*   **Wallpapers:** Making a small image fit your 4K monitor.

## How to use our AI Upscaler:

1.  Go to [AI Image Upscaler](/tool/upscale).
2.  Upload your small or blurry image.
3.  Select **2x** or **4x** magnification.
4.  Click "Start Upscaling". The AI runs directly in your browser!
5.  Download the enhanced image.

Instagram is a visual-first platform, and uploading the wrong size can ruin your high-quality photos. Instagram automatically compresses larger images, which can make them look blurry. To avoid this, you should resize your images to the exact specifications.

## Quick Reference Cheat Sheet (2025)

| Post Type | Aspect Ratio | Resolution (px) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Profile Picture** | 1:1 (Square) | 320 x 320 |
| **Square Post** | 1:1 | 1080 x 1080 |
| **Portrait Post** | 4:5 | 1080 x 1350 |
| **Landscape Post** | 1.91:1 | 1080 x 566 |
| **Stories** | 9:16 | 1080 x 1920 |
| **Reels** | 9:16 | 1080 x 1920 |
| **Stories Highlights** | 1:1 | 161 x 161 (Cover) |

## 1. Instagram Profile Picture
Your profile picture is the face of your brand. It appears as a circle, but you should upload a **320x320 pixel square**.
*   **Tip:** Center your logo or face so it doesn't get cut off by the circle crop.
*   **Format:** JPG or PNG.

## 2. Instagram Feed Posts

### Portrait (4:5) - The Best for Engagement
We strongly recommend using the **4:5 ratio (1080 x 1350 px)**.
*   **Why?** It takes up significantly more vertical screen space on mobile than a square image.
*   **Result:** Users spend more time looking at your post as they scroll, increasing the likelihood of engagement.

### Square (1:1) - The Classic
The traditional **1080 x 1080 px** size.
*   **Best for:** Multi-image carousels where you want a uniform look.
*   **Note:** It takes up less screen space than portrait.

### Landscape (1.91:1) - Avoid if possible
Sized at **1080 x 566 px**.
*   **Cons:** It looks very small on mobile devices and often gets ignored. Only use this for wide panoramic shots that absolutely cannot be cropped.

---

## 3. Instagram Stories & Reels
Both Stories and Reels share the full-screen **9:16 ratio (1080 x 1920 px)**.

### Safe Zones
When designing for Stories/Reels, keep important text and logos centered.
*   **Top 14% (approx 250px):** Covered by the Instagram logo and profile name.
*   **Bottom 20% (approx 420px):** Covered by the caption, likes, and comment overlay.

If you take photos with an iPhone, you've probably noticed they are saved as **.HEIC** files. While high quality, these files often can't be opened on Windows, Android, or older software.

## What is HEIC?

**HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container)** is Apple's version of the HEIF format. It uses modern compression technology to save photos at half the file size of a JPG without losing quality. This saves massive amounts of space on your phone.

## The Compatibility Problem

Despite its benefits, HEIC is not universally supported.
*   **Windows:** Requires paid extensions to view natively (in older versions).
*   **Websites:** Most forms (passports, job applications) only accept JPG or PNG.
*   **Android:** Older devices cannot open them.

## Solution: Convert to JPG in Browser

You don't need to install suspect software to convert your files.

1.  Use our [HEIC to JPG Converter](/tool/compress).
2.  Upload your .HEIC files.
3.  Our tool converts them instantly using your browser's processing power.
4.  Download standard .JPG files compatible everywhere.

## 5 Rules for a Perfect Passport Photo

1.  **Lighting is Key**: Face a window for natural, even light. No shadows on your face or the background.
2.  **Neutral Expression**: Mouth closed, eyes open, looking directly at the camera. No smiling (for most biometric passports).
3.  **Plain Background**: Use a white or off-white wall. If you don't have one, use our **Background Remover** first.
4.  **No Glasses**: Most countries (including the US) now ban glasses in passport photos to avoid glare.
5.  **Recent**: The photo must be taken within the last 6 months.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

**Step 1: Take the photo**
Stand 1 meter away from a white wall. Have someone else take the photo (selfies often distort features). Leave plenty of space above your head.

**Step 2: Remove Background (Optional)**
If your wall isn't perfectly white, use our [AI Background Remover](/tool/remove-bg) to clean it up.

**Step 3: Crop & Resize**
1.  Go to our [Passport Crop Tool](/tool/crop).
2.  Upload your photo.
3.  Select the preset for your country (e.g., "Passport 3.5x4.5cm").
4.  **Crucial:** Align your eyes with the grid guide. Your head should fill 70-80% of the frame.
5.  Download the result.

**Step 4: Print**
Print the downloaded image on 4x6 inch (10x15cm) photo paper at any pharmacy (CVS, Boots, etc.). You'll typically fit 4-6 passport photos on one standard print.

Images account for **50-75%** of the total byte weight of a typical webpage. If you are still using standard PNGs or JPEGs, you are likely failing Google's Core Web Vitals (specifically LCP). The solution is to switch to a modern, next-gen format: **WebP**.

## WebP vs PNG vs JPEG: The Data

WebP is a modern image format developed by Google that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web.

| Feature | PNG | JPEG | WebP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transparency** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Animation** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **File Size** | Heavy | Medium | **Lightest** |
| **Quality** | Lossless | Lossy | Hybrid |

### Key Improvements:
*   **26% smaller** than PNGs (while maintaining transparency).
*   **25-34% smaller** than comparable JPEG images.
*   **Supported by** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (96% global support).

---

## Why Google Rewards WebP

Google's ranking algorithm prioritizes User Experience. A faster site means a better experience.
*   **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** Large banners load instantly as WebP.
*   **Mobile Data:** Users on 4G/5G save data, reducing bounce rates.

> "WebP is an incredibly efficient format... it allows you to create smaller, richer images that make the web faster." - *Google Developers*

---

## How to Convert to WebP (Batch Process)

You don't need to export files one by one from Photoshop.

1.  Gather your assets (logos, product shots, banners).
2.  Go to our [WebP Converter Tool](/tool/compress).
3.  **Drag & Drop** up to 50 images at once.
4.  The tool automatically converts them to WebP.
5.  Download the ZIP file.

## Implementation Tip for Developers

If you are coding a website, use the \`<picture>\` tag to provide a fallback for ancient browsers (like Internet Explorer).

\`\`\`html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.png" alt="My Image">
</picture>
\`\`\`

But for 99% of use cases in 2026, you can just use the \`.webp\` file directly!

Sending multiple image files via email is unprofessional and messy. Whether you are submitting a homework assignment, sending receipts to your accountant, or building a portfolio, combining images into a single PDF is the standard way to go.

## Why convert to PDF?

*   **Universal:** a PDF looks the same on every device (Phone, Mac, Windows).
*   **Compact:** One file is easier to manage than 20 separate JPGs.
*   **Professional:** It shows you are organized.

## How to use our Converter

1.  Go to [Images to PDF](/tool/pdf).
2.  Select multiple images (JPG, PNG, or WebP).
3.  Drag to reorder them if needed.
4.  Click **"Convert to PDF"**.
5.  Your browser generates the PDF instantly.

## Workflow Tips
*   **Scan Documents:** Take photos of your paper documents, crop them using our [Crop Tool](/tool/crop), and then merge them into a PDF.
*   **Portfolios:** Combine your best work into a PDF to send to clients.

## Privacy First
Unlike other sites, we **do not** upload your private documents to a server. The PDF conversion happens 100% inside your browser. Your data never leaves your device.

Discord is the heart of gaming communities, and custom emojis are their language. But there is nothing worse than uploading a perfect meme only to have it rejected because the file size is too big, or looking blurry in chat.

## Discord Emoji Requirements 2025

Here are the strict rules you need to follow:

| Type | Max File Size | Dimensions | Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Emoji** | 256 KB | 128x128 px | JPG, PNG, GIF |
| **Animated Emoji** | 256 KB | 128x128 px | GIF |
| **Stickers** | 512 KB | 320x320 px | PNG, APNG, Lottie |

## The "Wumboji" Effect
If you post a message containing *only* emojis (and no text), they appear larger in the chat. This is called a Wumboji. To make sure these look crisp, you should upload them at the full **128x128** resolution, even though they scale down to 32x32 in normal text.

## How to Create the Perfect Emoji

### 1. Crop to a Square
Discord will automatically crop your image, but it might cut off the best parts.
*   Use our [Crop Tool](/tool/crop) to center the action.
*   Select the "Square (1:1)" aspect ratio.

### 2. Remove the Background
Square photos look bad as emojis. You want the subject to "float" in the chat.
*   Use the [Background Remover](/tool/remove-bg) first.
*   Download as PNG (to keep transparency).

### 3. Resize & Compress
If your file is over 256KB, Discord won't accept it.
*   Upload your PNG to our [Compress Tool](/tool/compress).
*   It will reduce the file size without making it look pixelated.

Amazon adds millions of products every year. To keep quality high, they have automated bots that suppress listings with bad images. Don't let that happen to you.

## The "Main Image" Rules

The first image customers see has the strictest rules. If you break these, your listing **will** be hidden.
*   **Pure White Background:** RGB (255, 255, 255). No exceptions.
*   **85% Coverage:** The product must take up at least 85% of the image frame.
*   **No Text/Logos:** You cannot add "Best Seller" badges or your own watermark.
*   **No Props:** Do not show accessories that aren't included.

## Technical Specs
*   **Minimum Size:** 500px on the longest side.
*   **Zoom Capability:** 1000px+ (Recommended 1600px+).
*   **Format:** JPEG is preferred. PNG and GIF are technically allowed but not recommended for the main image.
*   **Color Mode:** sRGB.

## How to Check Your Images
1.  **Zoom Check:** Is your image at least 1000px wide? If not, use our [AI Upscaler](/tool/upscale) to double the resolution without blur.
2.  **Background Check:** Is it pure white? Use our [Background Remover](/tool/remove-bg) to instantly isolate your product on white.

We process thousands of images every day. Here are the most common questions we get about shrinking images.

## 1. lossy vs. Lossless: What's the difference?
*   **Lossless Compression:** Reduces file size by cleaning up metadata and inefficient coding. The image pixels remain *identical*. Good for a 10-20% reduction.
*   **Lossy Compression:** intelligently merges similar colors that the human eye can't distinguish. This can reduce file size by **70-90%**. This is what most people need for the web.

## 2. Will compression make my photo blurry?
Not necessarily. Modern AI compression (like we use) is "visually lossless." It changes the data, but your eye usually can't tell the difference unless you zoom in 500%.

## 3. Why should I use WebP?
WebP is a modern format from Google.
*   It supports transparency (like PNG).
*   It compresses better than JPEG.
*   It loads 30% faster on websites.
*   **Recommendation:** Use our [WebP Converter](/tool/compress) for all website images.

## 4. Why is my file size still big after resizing?
If you resize an image from 4000px to 2000px, it's 4x smaller. But if the DPI is high or the quality setting is 100%, it might still be heavy. Use the **Compress** tool after resizing to get the best of both worlds.

Instagram grids (also known as "split images" or "profile banners") are a creative way to turn your profile into a giant canvas. By splitting a single high-quality photo into 3, 6, or 9 separate posts, you can make a huge impact on anyone visiting your profile.

## What is a 3x3 Grid?

A 3x3 grid is simply one large image sliced into 9 equal squares. When uploaded to Instagram in the correct order, they fit together to reform the original image on your profile page.

## How to Create a Grid Split
You don't need Photoshop to do this. Our tool handles the math and slicing for you.

1.  **Choose a High-Res Photo:** Since you are zooming in, make sure your original image is high quality.
2.  **Go to the [Grid Splitter Tool](/instagram-grid-maker).**
3.  **Upload your image.**
4.  **Select Layout:** Choose "3x3" for a large square grid, or "3x1" for a row.
5.  **Download:** We give you a ZIP file with all the numbered pieces.

## How to Post (The Trick)
The most important part is the order. You must post the **bottom-right** image first, and the **top-left** image last.
*   Our tool numbers the files for you.
*   If you see files named 1, 2, 3... post them in that order (1 first).

Sharing screenshots is part of daily life, but they often contain data you don't want the world to see: real names, addresses, passwords, or faces of bystanders.

## Why you must redact

*   **Identity Theft:** Never share credit card numbers or IDs.
*   **Professionalism:** Blur internal company data before sharing work.

## The Problem with "Blacking Out"
Using a black marker tool on your phone is sometimes risky. If you don't make it 100% opaque, hackers can sometimes reverse the contrast to read the text underneath. **Blurring or Pixelating** is often safer and looks cleaner.

## How to Blur Securely (Client-Side)

Sharing raw screenshots on social media often looks messy. They blend into the background, have distracting desktop clutter, and lack visual hierarchy.

## Why use a Screenshot Beautifier?

A "beautified" screenshot adds padding, a nice background, and a drop shadow to make your image pop. It's the standard for:
*   **Twitter/X Posts:** Making your app or code snippet stand out in the feed.
*   **Landing Pages:** Showcasing your product with a professional window frame.
*   **Newsletters:** Clean visuals that look good in email clients.

## Features of our Tool
Our [Screenshot Beautifier](/tool/screenshot-beautifier) provides:
*   **Mac-style Window Frames:** Instantly add the red-yellow-green window controls.
*   **Custom Backgrounds:** Choose from trendy gradients or solid brand colors.
*   **Smart Shadows:** Add depth to lift the image off the page.
*   **Rounded Corners:** Soften the harsh edges of rectangle screenshots.

## How to use it:
1.  Go to the [Screenshot Beautifier](/tool/screenshot-beautifier).
2.  **Upload** your raw screenshot.
3.  **Customize:**
    *   Toggle "Show Window Frame" for that desktop app look.
    *   Adjust the "Padding" slider to frame your image.
    *   Pick a background gradient that matches your vibe.
4.  **Download:** Get a high-resolution PNG ready for sharing.

## Step-by-Step Guide
1.  Take a selfie or use an existing photo where you look approachable.
2.  Open the [Profile Picture Maker](/tool/profile-picture-maker).
3.  **Upload** your photo. The AI automatically removes the background.
