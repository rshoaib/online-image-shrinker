One of the most common problems in digital photography is low resolution. Maybe you cropped a photo too much, or you have an old image from a 2010 smartphone. Traditional resizing makes these images pixelated and blurry. AI Upscaling solves this.

## What is AI Upscaling?

Unlike standard resizing (which just stretches pixels), AI Upscaling uses machine learning models trained on millions of images to "guess" and reconstruct the missing details. It literally adds new pixels to the image that look natural, resulting in sharp edges and clear textures.

## When should you upscale?

*   **Printing:** If your image is too small to print on a poster or canvas.
*   **Restoration:** Fixing old, grainy family photos.
*   **Web Assets:** Improving the quality of product images for your store.
*   **Wallpapers:** Making a small image fit your 4K monitor.

## How to use our AI Upscaler:

1.  Go to [AI Image Upscaler](/tool/upscale).
2.  Upload your small or blurry image.
3.  Select **2x** or **4x** magnification.
4.  Click "Start Upscaling". The AI runs directly in your browser!
5.  Download the enhanced image.

Instagram is a visual-first platform, and uploading the wrong size can ruin your high-quality photos. Instagram automatically compresses larger images, which can make them look blurry. To avoid this, you should resize your images to the exact specifications.

## Optimal Dimensions for 2025

| Post Type | Aspect Ratio | Resolution (px) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Square Post** | 1:1 | 1080 x 1080 |
| **Portrait Post** | 4:5 | 1080 x 1350 |
| **Landscape Post** | 1.91:1 | 1080 x 566 |
| **Stories & Reels** | 9:16 | 1080 x 1920 |
| **Profile Picture** | 1:1 | 320 x 320 |

## Why use 4:5 Ratio?

The vertical **4:5 ratio (1080x1350)** takes up the most screen real estate on mobile devices. This gives your content more visibility and engagement compared to landscape or square photos.

## How to Resize Instantly

1.  Go to our [Tool Selector](/).
2.  Select **Crop Image**.
3.  Upload your photo.
4.  Choose the "Instagram Portrait" or "Instagram Story" preset.
5.  Download the perfectly sized image.

If you take photos with an iPhone, you've probably noticed they are saved as **.HEIC** files. While high quality, these files often can't be opened on Windows, Android, or older software.

## What is HEIC?

**HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container)** is Apple's version of the HEIF format. It uses modern compression technology to save photos at half the file size of a JPG without losing quality. This saves massive amounts of space on your phone.

## The Compatibility Problem

Despite its benefits, HEIC is not universally supported.
*   **Windows:** Requires paid extensions to view natively (in older versions).
*   **Websites:** Most forms (passports, job applications) only accept JPG or PNG.
*   **Android:** Older devices cannot open them.

## Solution: Convert to JPG in Browser

You don't need to install suspect software to convert your files.

1.  Use our [HEIC to JPG Converter](/tool/compress).
2.  Upload your .HEIC files.
3.  Our tool converts them instantly using your browser's processing power.
4.  Download standard .JPG files compatible everywhere.

Applying for a visa or renewing a passport often requires a digital photo with very specific dimensions. The standard size for many countries (UK, Europe, Australia, etc.) is **35mm x 45mm**.

## Requirements checklist

*   **Size:** 35mm width x 45mm height.
*   **Background:** Plain white or light grey (use our [Background Remover](/tool/remove-bg) first!).
*   **Expression:** Neutral expression, mouth closed, looking at camera.
*   **Lighting:** Even lighting, no shadows on face.

## How to crop correctly

Most people get rejected because of bad cropping. The head should take up 70-80% of the vertical height.

1.  Take a photo with your phone against a white wall.
2.  Upload it to our [Crop Tool](/tool/crop).
3.  Select the "Passport (3.5x4.5)" ratio.
4.  Adjust the crop box so your face is centered.
5.  Download and print or submit online.

Images are the #1 cause of slow websites. If you are uploading standard PNGs or JPEGs to your site, you are likely failing Google's Core Web Vitals tests. The solution? **WebP**.

## What is WebP?
WebP is a modern image format developed by Google. It supports:
*   **Lossy Compression:** Like JPEG, but 25-34% smaller.
*   **Transparency:** Like PNG, but 26% smaller.
*   **Animation:** Like GIF, but much higher quality.

## Impact on SEO
Google explicitly rewards faster sites. Using next-gen formats like WebP is a specific recommendation in PageSpeed Insights.

## How to batch convert to WebP

1.  Gather your website assets (logos, banners, product shots).
2.  Go to [Compress Images](/tool/compress).
3.  Upload up to 50 images at once.
4.  The tool automatically optimizes them.
5.  Replace the old images on your server.

Sending multiple image files via email is unprofessional and messy. Whether you are submitting a homework assignment, sending receipts to your accountant, or building a portfolio, combining images into a single PDF is the standard way to go.

## Why convert to PDF?

*   **Universal:** a PDF looks the same on every device (Phone, Mac, Windows).
*   **Compact:** One file is easier to manage than 20 separate JPGs.
*   **Professional:** It shows you are organized.

## How to use our Converter

1.  Go to [Images to PDF](/tool/pdf).
2.  Select multiple images (JPG, PNG, or WebP).
3.  Drag to reorder them if needed.
4.  Click **"Convert to PDF"**.
5.  Your browser generates the PDF instantly.

## Workflow Tips
*   **Scan Documents:** Take photos of your paper documents, crop them using our [Crop Tool](/tool/crop), and then merge them into a PDF.
*   **Portfolios:** Combine your best work into a PDF to send to clients.

## Privacy First
Unlike other sites, we **do not** upload your private documents to a server. The PDF conversion happens 100% inside your browser. Your data never leaves your device.
