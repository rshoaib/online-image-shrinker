One of the most common problems in digital photography is low resolution. Maybe you cropped a photo too much, or you have an old image from a 2010 smartphone. Traditional resizing makes these images pixelated and blurry. AI Upscaling solves this.

## What is AI Upscaling?

Unlike standard resizing (which just stretches pixels), AI Upscaling uses machine learning models trained on millions of images to "guess" and reconstruct the missing details. It literally adds new pixels to the image that look natural, resulting in sharp edges and clear textures.

## When should you upscale?

*   **Printing:** If your image is too small to print on a poster or canvas.
*   **Restoration:** Fixing old, grainy family photos.
*   **Web Assets:** Improving the quality of product images for your store.
*   **Wallpapers:** Making a small image fit your 4K monitor.

## How to use our AI Upscaler:

1.  Go to [AI Image Upscaler](/tool/upscale).
2.  Upload your small or blurry image.
3.  Select **2x** or **4x** magnification.
4.  Click "Start Upscaling". The AI runs directly in your browser!
5.  Download the enhanced image.

Instagram is a visual-first platform, and uploading the wrong size can ruin your high-quality photos. Instagram automatically compresses larger images, which can make them look blurry. To avoid this, you should resize your images to the exact specifications.

## Quick Reference Cheat Sheet (2025)

| Post Type | Aspect Ratio | Resolution (px) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Profile Picture** | 1:1 (Square) | 320 x 320 |
| **Square Post** | 1:1 | 1080 x 1080 |
| **Portrait Post** | 4:5 | 1080 x 1350 |
| **Landscape Post** | 1.91:1 | 1080 x 566 |
| **Stories** | 9:16 | 1080 x 1920 |
| **Reels** | 9:16 | 1080 x 1920 |
| **Stories Highlights** | 1:1 | 161 x 161 (Cover) |

## 1. Instagram Profile Picture
Your profile picture is the face of your brand. It appears as a circle, but you should upload a **320x320 pixel square**.
*   **Tip:** Center your logo or face so it doesn't get cut off by the circle crop.
*   **Format:** JPG or PNG.

## 2. Instagram Feed Posts

### Portrait (4:5) - The Best for Engagement
We strongly recommend using the **4:5 ratio (1080 x 1350 px)**.
*   **Why?** It takes up significantly more vertical screen space on mobile than a square image.
*   **Result:** Users spend more time looking at your post as they scroll, increasing the likelihood of engagement.

### Square (1:1) - The Classic
The traditional **1080 x 1080 px** size.
*   **Best for:** Multi-image carousels where you want a uniform look.
*   **Note:** It takes up less screen space than portrait.

### Landscape (1.91:1) - Avoid if possible
Sized at **1080 x 566 px**.
*   **Cons:** It looks very small on mobile devices and often gets ignored. Only use this for wide panoramic shots that absolutely cannot be cropped.

---

## 3. Instagram Stories & Reels
Both Stories and Reels share the full-screen **9:16 ratio (1080 x 1920 px)**.

### Safe Zones
When designing for Stories/Reels, keep important text and logos centered.
*   **Top 14% (approx 250px):** Covered by the Instagram logo and profile name.
*   **Bottom 20% (approx 420px):** Covered by the caption, likes, and comment overlay.

If you take photos with an iPhone, you've probably noticed they are saved as **.HEIC** files. While high quality, these files often can't be opened on Windows, Android, or older software.

## What is HEIC?

**HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container)** is Apple's version of the HEIF format. It uses modern compression technology to save photos at half the file size of a JPG without losing quality. This saves massive amounts of space on your phone.

## The Compatibility Problem

Despite its benefits, HEIC is not universally supported.
*   **Windows:** Requires paid extensions to view natively (in older versions).
*   **Websites:** Most forms (passports, job applications) only accept JPG or PNG.
*   **Android:** Older devices cannot open them.

## Solution: Convert to JPG in Browser

You don't need to install suspect software to convert your files.

1.  Use our [HEIC to JPG Converter](/tool/compress).
2.  Upload your .HEIC files.
3.  Our tool converts them instantly using your browser's processing power.
4.  Download standard .JPG files compatible everywhere.

## 5 Rules for a Perfect Passport Photo

1.  **Lighting is Key**: Face a window for natural, even light. No shadows on your face or the background.
2.  **Neutral Expression**: Mouth closed, eyes open, looking directly at the camera. No smiling (for most biometric passports).
3.  **Plain Background**: Use a white or off-white wall. If you don't have one, use our **Background Remover** first.
4.  **No Glasses**: Most countries (including the US) now ban glasses in passport photos to avoid glare.
5.  **Recent**: The photo must be taken within the last 6 months.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

**Step 1: Take the photo**
Stand 1 meter away from a white wall. Have someone else take the photo (selfies often distort features). Leave plenty of space above your head.

**Step 2: Remove Background (Optional)**
If your wall isn't perfectly white, use our [AI Background Remover](/tool/remove-bg) to clean it up.

**Step 3: Crop & Resize**
1.  Go to our [Passport Crop Tool](/tool/crop).
2.  Upload your photo.
3.  Select the preset for your country (e.g., "Passport 3.5x4.5cm").
4.  **Crucial:** Align your eyes with the grid guide. Your head should fill 70-80% of the frame.
5.  Download the result.

**Step 4: Print**
Print the downloaded image on 4x6 inch (10x15cm) photo paper at any pharmacy (CVS, Boots, etc.). You'll typically fit 4-6 passport photos on one standard print.

Images account for **50-75%** of the total byte weight of a typical webpage. If you are still using standard PNGs or JPEGs, you are likely failing Google's Core Web Vitals (specifically LCP). The solution is to switch to a modern, next-gen format: **WebP**.

## WebP vs PNG vs JPEG: The Data

WebP is a modern image format developed by Google that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web.

| Feature | PNG | JPEG | WebP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transparency** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Animation** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **File Size** | Heavy | Medium | **Lightest** |
| **Quality** | Lossless | Lossy | Hybrid |

### Key Improvements:
*   **26% smaller** than PNGs (while maintaining transparency).
*   **25-34% smaller** than comparable JPEG images.
*   **Supported by** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (96% global support).

---

## Why Google Rewards WebP

Google's ranking algorithm prioritizes User Experience. A faster site means a better experience.
*   **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** Large banners load instantly as WebP.
*   **Mobile Data:** Users on 4G/5G save data, reducing bounce rates.

> "WebP is an incredibly efficient format... it allows you to create smaller, richer images that make the web faster." - *Google Developers*

---

## How to Convert to WebP (Batch Process)

You don't need to export files one by one from Photoshop.

1.  Gather your assets (logos, product shots, banners).
2.  Go to our [WebP Converter Tool](/tool/compress).
3.  **Drag & Drop** up to 50 images at once.
4.  The tool automatically converts them to WebP.
5.  Download the ZIP file.

## Implementation Tip for Developers

If you are coding a website, use the \`<picture>\` tag to provide a fallback for ancient browsers (like Internet Explorer).

\`\`\`html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.png" alt="My Image">
</picture>
\`\`\`

But for 99% of use cases in 2026, you can just use the \`.webp\` file directly!

Sending multiple image files via email is unprofessional and messy. Whether you are submitting a homework assignment, sending receipts to your accountant, or building a portfolio, combining images into a single PDF is the standard way to go.

## Why convert to PDF?

*   **Universal:** a PDF looks the same on every device (Phone, Mac, Windows).
*   **Compact:** One file is easier to manage than 20 separate JPGs.
*   **Professional:** It shows you are organized.

## How to use our Converter

1.  Go to [Images to PDF](/tool/pdf).
2.  Select multiple images (JPG, PNG, or WebP).
3.  Drag to reorder them if needed.
4.  Click **"Convert to PDF"**.
5.  Your browser generates the PDF instantly.

## Workflow Tips
*   **Scan Documents:** Take photos of your paper documents, crop them using our [Crop Tool](/tool/crop), and then merge them into a PDF.
*   **Portfolios:** Combine your best work into a PDF to send to clients.

## Privacy First
Unlike other sites, we **do not** upload your private documents to a server. The PDF conversion happens 100% inside your browser. Your data never leaves your device.

Discord is the heart of gaming communities, and custom emojis are their language. But there is nothing worse than uploading a perfect meme only to have it rejected because the file size is too big, or looking blurry in chat.

## Discord Emoji Requirements 2025

Here are the strict rules you need to follow:

| Type | Max File Size | Dimensions | Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard Emoji** | 256 KB | 128x128 px | JPG, PNG, GIF |
| **Animated Emoji** | 256 KB | 128x128 px | GIF |
| **Stickers** | 512 KB | 320x320 px | PNG, APNG, Lottie |

## The "Wumboji" Effect
If you post a message containing *only* emojis (and no text), they appear larger in the chat. This is called a Wumboji. To make sure these look crisp, you should upload them at the full **128x128** resolution, even though they scale down to 32x32 in normal text.

## How to Create the Perfect Emoji

### 1. Crop to a Square
Discord will automatically crop your image, but it might cut off the best parts.
*   Use our [Crop Tool](/tool/crop) to center the action.
*   Select the "Square (1:1)" aspect ratio.

### 2. Remove the Background
Square photos look bad as emojis. You want the subject to "float" in the chat.
*   Use the [Background Remover](/tool/remove-bg) first.
*   Download as PNG (to keep transparency).

### 3. Resize & Compress
If your file is over 256KB, Discord won't accept it.
*   Upload your PNG to our [Compress Tool](/tool/compress).
*   It will reduce the file size without making it look pixelated.

Amazon adds millions of products every year. To keep quality high, they have automated bots that suppress listings with bad images. Don't let that happen to you.

## The "Main Image" Rules

The first image customers see has the strictest rules. If you break these, your listing **will** be hidden.
*   **Pure White Background:** RGB (255, 255, 255). No exceptions.
*   **85% Coverage:** The product must take up at least 85% of the image frame.
*   **No Text/Logos:** You cannot add "Best Seller" badges or your own watermark.
*   **No Props:** Do not show accessories that aren't included.

## Technical Specs
*   **Minimum Size:** 500px on the longest side.
*   **Zoom Capability:** 1000px+ (Recommended 1600px+).
*   **Format:** JPEG is preferred. PNG and GIF are technically allowed but not recommended for the main image.
*   **Color Mode:** sRGB.

## How to Check Your Images
1.  **Zoom Check:** Is your image at least 1000px wide? If not, use our [AI Upscaler](/tool/upscale) to double the resolution without blur.
2.  **Background Check:** Is it pure white? Use our [Background Remover](/tool/remove-bg) to instantly isolate your product on white.

We process thousands of images every day. Here are the most common questions we get about shrinking images.

## 1. lossy vs. Lossless: What's the difference?
*   **Lossless Compression:** Reduces file size by cleaning up metadata and inefficient coding. The image pixels remain *identical*. Good for a 10-20% reduction.
*   **Lossy Compression:** intelligently merges similar colors that the human eye can't distinguish. This can reduce file size by **70-90%**. This is what most people need for the web.

## 2. Will compression make my photo blurry?
Not necessarily. Modern AI compression (like we use) is "visually lossless." It changes the data, but your eye usually can't tell the difference unless you zoom in 500%.

## 3. Why should I use WebP?
WebP is a modern format from Google.
*   It supports transparency (like PNG).
*   It compresses better than JPEG.
*   It loads 30% faster on websites.
*   **Recommendation:** Use our [WebP Converter](/tool/compress) for all website images.

## 4. Why is my file size still big after resizing?
If you resize an image from 4000px to 2000px, it's 4x smaller. But if the DPI is high or the quality setting is 100%, it might still be heavy. Use the **Compress** tool after resizing to get the best of both worlds.

Instagram grids (also known as "split images" or "profile banners") are a creative way to turn your profile into a giant canvas. By splitting a single high-quality photo into 3, 6, or 9 separate posts, you can make a huge impact on anyone visiting your profile.

## What is a 3x3 Grid?

A 3x3 grid is simply one large image sliced into 9 equal squares. When uploaded to Instagram in the correct order, they fit together to reform the original image on your profile page.

## How to Create a Grid Split
You don't need Photoshop to do this. Our tool handles the math and slicing for you.

1.  **Choose a High-Res Photo:** Since you are zooming in, make sure your original image is high quality.
2.  **Go to the [Grid Splitter Tool](/instagram-grid-maker).**
3.  **Upload your image.**
4.  **Select Layout:** Choose "3x3" for a large square grid, or "3x1" for a row.
5.  **Download:** We give you a ZIP file with all the numbered pieces.

## How to Post (The Trick)
The most important part is the order. You must post the **bottom-right** image first, and the **top-left** image last.
*   Our tool numbers the files for you.
*   If you see files named 1, 2, 3... post them in that order (1 first).

Sharing screenshots is part of daily life, but they often contain data you don't want the world to see: real names, addresses, passwords, or faces of bystanders.

## Why you must redact

*   **Identity Theft:** Never share credit card numbers or IDs.
*   **Professionalism:** Blur internal company data before sharing work.

## The Problem with "Blacking Out"
Using a black marker tool on your phone is sometimes risky. If you don't make it 100% opaque, hackers can sometimes reverse the contrast to read the text underneath. **Blurring or Pixelating** is often safer and looks cleaner.

## How to Blur Securely (Client-Side)

Sharing raw screenshots on social media often looks messy. They blend into the background, have distracting desktop clutter, and lack visual hierarchy.

## Why use a Screenshot Beautifier?

A "beautified" screenshot adds padding, a nice background, and a drop shadow to make your image pop. It's the standard for:
*   **Twitter/X Posts:** Making your app or code snippet stand out in the feed.
*   **Landing Pages:** Showcasing your product with a professional window frame.
*   **Newsletters:** Clean visuals that look good in email clients.

## Features of our Tool
Our [Screenshot Beautifier](/tool/screenshot-beautifier) provides:
*   **Mac-style Window Frames:** Instantly add the red-yellow-green window controls.
*   **Custom Backgrounds:** Choose from trendy gradients or solid brand colors.
*   **Smart Shadows:** Add depth to lift the image off the page.
*   **Rounded Corners:** Soften the harsh edges of rectangle screenshots.

## How to use it:
1.  Go to the [Screenshot Beautifier](/tool/screenshot-beautifier).
2.  **Upload** your raw screenshot.
3.  **Customize:**
    *   Toggle "Show Window Frame" for that desktop app look.
    *   Adjust the "Padding" slider to frame your image.
    *   Pick a background gradient that matches your vibe.
4.  **Download:** Get a high-resolution PNG ready for sharing.

2.  Open the [Profile Picture Maker](/tool/profile-picture-maker).
3.  **Upload** your photo. The AI automatically removes the background.

Professional photographers know the pain: you shoot 500 photos at an event, edit them, and then need to watermark them all before sending proofs to the client. Using Photoshop actions is slow, and online tools usually require you to upload your gigabytes of data to their server.

## The "Local" Advantage
Our **Batch Watermarker** runs in your browser. This means:
1.  **Speed**: No upload time. The tool reads files from your disk instantly.
2.  **Privacy**: Your client's photos never leave your computer.
3.  **Cost**: It's 100% free.

## How to Watermark 50+ Photos at Once

### Step 1: Open the Tool
Navigate to the [Watermark Tool](/tool/watermark).

### Step 2: Select Images
Drag and drop your entire folder of JPGs or PNGs. Don't worry about quantity—our engine handles it.

### Step 3: Customize Your Mark
*   **Text Mode**: Type your copyright (e.g., "© 2026 Studio Name"). Choose a font and color.
*   **Logo Mode**: Upload your transparent PNG logo.
*   **Positioning**: Use the 9-point grid to snap the watermark to the bottom-right or center.

### Step 4: Batch Export
Click "Download All". We'll zip them up into a single archive for you.

A blurry or badly cropped thumbnail can kill a video's CTR (Click Through Rate) before it even gets a chance. YouTube's requirements seem simple, but there are hidden traps.

## The Specs (2026 Update)
*   **Resolution**: 1280 x 720 pixels (Minimum width 640px).
*   **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9.
*   **Max File Size**: 2MB.
*   **Formats**: JPG, GIF, BMP, or PNG.

## The "Safe Zone" Problem
On mobile, the bottom-right corner of your thumbnail is covered by the **Timestamp** (e.g., "10:24").
*   **Avoid:** Putting key text or logos in the bottom right corner.
*   **Do:** Keep the action centered or to the left.

## How to Check Your Thumbnail
Don't guess. Use our specific [YouTube Resizer](/resize-for-youtube) tool.
1.  Upload your image.
2.  The tool automatically locks the aspect ratio to **16:9**.
3.  It warns you if the resolution is too low.
4.  You can crop exactly what you need.

When you use a site like "TinyPNG" or "ILoveIMG", you are performing an **Upload**. You are physically sending your personal files—photos of your kids, scans of your documents, or expensive client work—to a server owned by a stranger.

## What happens on the server?
*   **Logging**: They might keep a copy of your file.
*   **Metadata**: They can read the GPS location data from your photos.
*   **Hacking Risk**: If their server gets breached, your data is exposed.

## The "Client-Side" Revolution
**Online Image Shrinker** is different. We use **WebAssembly (WASM)** technnology.
*   When you "upload" a file here, it actually just opens in your browser's memory.
*   The processing (compression, resizing, AI removal) happens on **your CPU**.
*   The result is saved directly to your disk.

**0 bytes** are sent to our server. You could literally turn off your WiFi after loading the page, and the tools would still work.

This is the future of privacy.

We are constantly working to make **Image Shrinker** not just the most private tool on the web, but also the fastest. Today's update focuses on speed and a little bit of fun.

## 1. Copy to Clipboard (Skip the Download)
We noticed many of you were downloading an image just to immediately paste it into Slack, Discord, or X (Twitter). We've removed that step.

You will now find a **"Copy"** button next to the download button in:
*   [Screenshot Beautifier](/tool/screenshot-beautifier)
*   [Profile Picture Maker](/tool/profile-picture)
*   [AI Upscaler](/tool/upscale)

Click it, and the image is instantly in your clipboard, ready to paste (\`Ctrl+V\`).

## 2. Celebration Mode 🎉
Completing a creative task feels good. Now it looks good too! When you successfully download your upscaled image or beautified screenshot, you'll get a little burst of confetti. It's our way of saying "Great job!"

## 3. Install as an App (PWA)
Did you know this website works offline?
*   **On Chrome/Edge:** Look for the "Install" icon in the address bar.
*   **On Mobile:** Tap "Share" -> "Add to Home Screen".
It will launch like a native app, with no browser bars and full-speed performance.

## What's Next?
We are working on **Batch Watermarking** improvements and looking into **Video Compression**. Stay tuned!

Memes are the language of the internet. Whether it's a reaction image, a cat photo, or a deep-fried shitpost, memes convey complex emotions in a single glance.

## The Classic Formula

While meme formats evolve daily, one style remains eternal: **Top Text, Bottom Text**.
*   **Font**: Impact (Bold, Condensed).
*   **Style**: White text with a thick black outline.
*   **Vibe**: Funny, relatable, or ironic.

## How to use our Meme Generator

Most online tools slap a giant watermark on your image or ask you to pay. **We don't.**

1.  Go to the [Meme Generator](/tool/meme-generator).
2.  **Upload** your image (or find a template).
3.  Type your **Top Text** (the setup).
4.  Type your **Bottom Text** (the punchline).
5.  **Drag** the text exactly where you want it. This is a new feature!
6.  Click **Download**.

## 3 Tips for Viral Memes

1.  **Relatability**: "Me when I wake up" is better than an inside joke.
2.  **Simplicity**: Keep the text short. If I have to read a paragraph, I'm scrolling past.
3.  **Speed**: Jump on trends fast. If everyone is talking about a new movie, make a meme about it *today*.

Did you know that every photo you take with your iPhone or Android phone contains hidden metadata? It's called **EXIF data**, and it can include:
*   **GPS Coordinates:** The exact location where the photo was taken (down to the street meter).
*   **Time & Date:** When the moment happened.
*   **Device Info:** Your exact phone model and camera settings.

## Why is this dangerous?
If you upload a photo of your pet or your new house to social media or a forum, savvy users can download that image and see exactly where you live. This is a major privacy risk.

## How to Check Your Photos
You can't see this data in your standard gallery app. You need an EXIF Viewer.

1.  Open our [EXIF Viewer & Remover](/tool/exif).
2.  **Upload** your photo.
3.  The tool will instantly show you all the hidden tags found in the file.
4.  If you see a map pin, your location is exposed.

## How to Remove It (The Easy Way)
You don't need to change your camera settings permanently. Just clean the files before you share them.

1.  In the EXIF Viewer tool, click **"Remove Metadata & Clean File"**.
2.  Our tool scrubs 100% of the EXIF tags while keeping the image quality identical.
3.  **Download** the safe, clean version.

Most email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) limit attachments to **25MB**. If you have a scanned document or a portfolio with high-res images, it's easy to hit that limit.

## Why is my PDF so big?
PDFs are usually large because they contain uncompressed images. A single scanned page can be 5MB-10MB if scanned at high DPI.

## The Fix: Images to Optimized PDF
If you have the source images, you can create a perfectly optimized PDF from scratch:

1.  Go to [Images to PDF](/tool/pdf).
2.  **Upload** your JPGs or PNGs.
3.  Our tool automatically compresses the visual data while keeping the text sharp.
4.  **Download** a PDF that is often 10x smaller than the original scans.

Choosing the wrong image format can make your website slow or your photos look blurry. Here is the simple breakdown you've been looking for.

## 1. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
*   **Best for:** Photos, real-world images with millions of colors.
*   **Pros:** Small file size, compatible with everything.
*   **Cons:** No transparency, "lossy" compression (can look blocky if compressed too much).

## 2. PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
*   **Best for:** Logos, screenshots, and graphics with sharp lines.
*   **Pros:** Supports **Transparency** (clear backgrounds). Lossless quality.
*   **Cons:** Giant file sizes. Never use PNG for photos unless you need to.

## 3. WebP (The Modern Standard)
*   **Best for:** Everything on the web.
*   **Pros:** 30% smaller than JPEG for the same quality. Supports transparency like PNG.
*   **Cons:** Older computers (Windows 7 era) might not open them natively.

## How to Convert Between Formats
Need to turn a huge PNG into a small WebP for your website? Or open a WebP file in Photoshop?

1.  Use our [Image Converter](/tool/image-converter).
2.  Upload your file.
3.  Select your target format (e.g., **WebP**).
4.  Drag the **Quality** slider (80% is the sweet spot).
5.  Click **Convert**.

*   **Aspect Ratio:** 4:1.

On Mobile, your profile picture moves! It shifts from the left to the center. This means you have two "danger zones" where you should never put text.

*   **Avoid:** Bottom-Left corner (Desktop overlap).
*   **Avoid:** Bottom-Center (Mobile overlap).

Great designers steal. But they don't steal artwork—they steal **colors**. One of the best ways to find a beautiful color scheme for your website or app is to take it from a movie scene or photograph you love.

## Why Movie Palettes work
Cinematographers spend millions of dollars lighting scenes to create a specific mood.
*   **Wes Anderson:** Pastel pinks and symmetrical yellows.
*   **Blade Runner:** Neon blues, pinks, and deep blacks.
*   **The Matrix:** Sickly greens and industrial greys.

By "stealing" these palettes, you get a professionally color-graded harmony for free.

## How to Extract Colors Instantly
You don't need to manually eyedrop colors in Photoshop one by one.

1.  **Find your inspiration:** Take a screenshot of a movie scene or find a photo on Pinterest.
2.  **Open the [Palette Generator](/tool/palette-generator).**
3.  **Upload the image.**
4.  The AI instantly finds the **Dominant Colors** and the **Accent Colors**.
5.  **Click to Copy:** Just tap the Hex code (e.g., #FF0088) to copy it to your clipboard.

## Design Tip: The 60-30-10 Rule
Once you have your palette, apply it using this rule:
*   **60%** of your design should be the dominant color (usually a neutral background).
*   **30%** should be the secondary color (cards, headers).
*   **10%** should be the accent color (buttons, links).

## The Requirements

Most countries (UK, EU, Australia) use the **35x45mm** standard. The US and India use **2x2 inches**.
Key biometric rules:
*   **Expression:** Neutral (no smiling).
*   **Eyes:** Fully visible (no glasses).
*   **Background:** Plain white or light grey.
*   **Lighting:** Even lighting, no shadows on face.

## How to use our Passport Photo Maker

We built a tool specifically to handle these strict requirements.

1.  **Take a Photo:** Stand against a white wall. Ask a friend to take a photo of you (selfies can distort your nose). Leave plenty of space above your head.
2.  **Go to [Passport Photo Maker](/resize-passport-photo).**
3.  **Upload:** Select your photo.
4.  **Use the Overlay:** Our tool shows a "Face Guide". Align your eyes and chin with the guide lines.
5.  **Crop:** Use the zoom slider to fit your head perfectly (70-80% of the image).
6.  **Download:** Get a perfectly sized image ready for printing.

Sometimes one photo isn't enough. Whether it's a "Before & After" shot, a fashion outfit check, or a mood board, a collage tells a complete story.

## Why Collage?

*   **Higher Engagement:** Stop users from scrolling by giving them 4x the content in one post.
*   **Storytelling:** Show the start and end of a trip side-by-side.
*   **Aesthetics:** A well-laid-out grid looks cleaner than a carousel dump.

## Popular Layouts

### 1. Side-by-Side (2 Photos)
Perfect for:
*   Before/After comparisons.
*   "This or That" polls.
*   Couple photos.

### 2. Vertical Stack (2 Photos)
Perfect for:
*   Pinterest pins.
*   Phone wallpapers.
*   Outfit details (Zoom in vs Full body).

### 3. Grid (4 Photos)
The classic 2x2. Perfect for:
*   Recaps of an event.
*   Product showcases (Front, Back, Detail, Use).

## How to Join Photos Online

Building a Shopify store is hard work. Don't let blurry product photos ruin your conversion rate. Shopify has specific requirements for images, and getting them wrong can lead to slow loading speeds or pixelated zoom.

## The Perfect Shopify Size: 2048 x 2048 px

While Shopify allows images up to 4472 x 4472 px, we recommend **2048 x 2048 pixels** (Square).
*   **Why?** It's the sweet spot for the "Zoom" feature. Customers can hover over the image to see texture details without the file being massive.
*   **Minimum:** 800 x 800 px (Below this, zoom won't work).

## Best Formats
*   **JPEG:** For photographs (models, lifestyle shots). It offers the best color with small file sizes.
*   **PNG:** Use ONLY if you need a transparent background. Otherwise, it makes the page load slower.
*   **WebP:** Shopify now supports WebP, which is even faster.

## How to Bulk Process Your Inventory
If you have 50 product photos from your supplier, resizing them one by one is a nightmare.

1.  Open our [Batch Editor](/tool/batch-editor).
2.  **Drag & Drop** all 50 images.
3.  Select the **"Shopify" Preset**.
    *   This automatically sets the width to 2048px.
    *   It converts them to High-Quality JPEG (85%).
4.  Click **Process All**.
5.  Download your optimized catalog in seconds.

Have you ever uploaded a beautiful vertical photo to Instagram, only to have the app forcibly crop off the top of your head or your shoes? The default "Square" (1:1) crop is a relic of 2010.

## The Secret Ratio: 4:5
The pros don't post squares. They post **Portraits**.
*   **Square (1:1):** 1080 x 1080 px.
*   **Portrait (4:5):** 1080 x 1350 px.

**The Math:** The Portrait aspect ratio gives you **25% more screen space** on a user's phone. That's 25% more pixels to sell your product, show your art, or grab attention.

## How to Fix Your Photos (Without Photoshop)
You don't need to guess the crop.

1.  Go to our [Batch Editor](/tool/batch-editor) (or the Crop tool).
2.  Upload your photo.
3.  Choose the **"IG Portrait" Preset**.
    *   This intelligently resizes your image to **1080px width**.
    *   It adjusts the height to **1350px**.
4.  If your image is too tall (9:16), use the Crop tool to center the subject first.

**Pro Tip:** This works perfectly for carousels too!

We live in an era of data breaches. Every week, a major company leaks millions of user passwords or files. So why would you trust a random "Free PDF Converter" with your bank statements or passport scans?

## The "Cloud" Problem
99% of online tools work like this:
1.  You upload file -> **Their Server**
2.  Server processes it -> **Creates Copy**
3.  Server sends back result -> **You Download**

**The Risk:** once the file is on their server, you have lost control. They could be logging it, selling the metadata, or just have weak security that hackers can exploit.

## The "Client-Side" Solution
**Online Image Shrinker** is built differently. We use a technology called **WebAssembly (WASM)**.

Think of it like downloading a small app that runs *inside* your browser tab.
*   **No Uploads:** Your image never leaves your computer.
*   **No Waiting:** Because it doesn't travel over the internet, processing is instant.
*   **100% Secure:** You could disconnect your internet cable, and our tools would still work perfectly.

## Test It Yourself
Open our [Compress Tool](/tool/compress), load a file, and then turn off your WiFi. The tool will keep working. That is the proof that your data stays with you.

Professional photos sell homes 32% faster. But most Realtors don't have time to master Photoshop. You need a fast, free workflow to get your listings from your camera to the MLS.

## The MLS Standard (Don't Get Rejected)

Most Multiple Listing Services (MLS) have strict requirements.
*   **Resolution**: Usually **3000px** on the wide side.
*   **Size Limit**: Under **10MB** (or 5MB for some).
*   **Format**: JPG only.

If you upload raw 20MB files from a DSLR, they will likely be rejected or compressed badly.

## The 3-Step Workflow for Realtors

### 1. Brighten Dark Rooms
A dark living room looks small and depressing.
*   **The Fix**: Use our **[Image Upscaler](/tool/upscale)**.
*   It doesn't just make images bigger; it uses AI to hallucinate details and balance lighting in dark areas.

### 2. Branding (Watermarking)
You worked hard for that listing. Don't let other aggregators steal your photos without credit.
*   **The Fix**: Use the **[Watermark Tool](/tool/watermark)**.
*   Upload your agency logo (Remax, KW, etc.) and stamp it in the bottom corner of 50 photos at once.

### 3. Resize for MLS
*   **The Fix**: Use our **[Bulk Resizer](/tool/resize)**.
*   Set the width to **3000px**. this is the sweet spot for Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com.

On Etsy, the photo *is* the product. A blurry or badly cropped thumbnail means zero clicks. Here is the cheat sheet for 2026.

## The Golden Ratio: 4:3

Etsy recommends a ratio of **4:3** for your main listing photo.
*   **Minimum Size**: 2000px wide.
*   **Ideal Size**: 3000px x 2250px.
*   **DPI**: 72 is fine for web.

## The Thumbnail Trap (1:1)
While the listing page shows a 4:3 image, **Etsy search results often crop to a square (1:1)**.
*   **Crucial Tip**: Keep your product centered! If you fill the entire 4:3 frame, your product's edges will be chopped off in search results.

## White Backgrounds = More Sales
Google Shopping integration requires a pure white background. If your photo is on a rug or table, Google might ignore it.
*   **Solution**: Use our **[Background Remover](/tool/remove-bg)** to instantly swap your messy table for pure white (#FFFFFF).

## How to optimize for Etsy
1.  **Crop** your raw photo to 4:3 using our [Crop Tool](/tool/crop).
2.  **Compress** it so it loads fast (Etsy ranks faster pages higher).
3.  **Rename** your file from "IMG_9921.jpg" to "handmade-silver-ring.jpg" for SEO.

Every email provider has attachment limits. When you try to send vacation photos, scanned documents, or product images, you've probably seen the dreaded **"Attachment too large"** error.

## Email Attachment Limits (2026)

| Provider | Max Attachment | Max Total per Email |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gmail** | 25 MB | 25 MB |
| **Outlook** | 20 MB | 20 MB |
| **Yahoo Mail** | 25 MB | 25 MB |
| **iCloud Mail** | 20 MB | 20 MB |
| **ProtonMail** | 25 MB | 25 MB |

A single photo from a modern smartphone is **3-8 MB**. That means you can only attach 3-4 photos before hitting the limit.

---

## Method 1: Compress Without Resizing

If you need to keep the original dimensions (for printing later), compression is your best option.

1.  Go to the [Compress Tool](/tool/compress).
2.  **Drag & Drop** your images.
3.  Adjust the quality slider — **70-80%** gives a great balance of size and quality.
4.  Download the compressed versions.

**Typical results:**
*   5 MB iPhone photo → **800 KB** (84% smaller)
*   8 MB DSLR photo → **1.2 MB** (85% smaller)

---

## Method 2: Resize + Compress (Maximum Reduction)

For email, nobody needs a 4000px wide image. Screens are typically 1920px or less.

1.  Go to the [Resize Tool](/tool/resize).
2.  Set the **width to 1600px** (more than enough for any screen).
3.  The height adjusts automatically to keep proportions.
4.  Then run the result through the [Compress Tool](/tool/compress).

**Result:** A 7 MB photo becomes **200-400 KB** — you can attach 50+ photos in one email!

---

## Method 3: Convert to WebP

WebP is 25-34% smaller than JPEG at the same quality.

1.  Use the [Image Converter](/tool/image-converter).
2.  Select **WebP** as the output format.
3.  Download.

> **Tip:** Most modern email clients can display WebP inline. However, if the recipient uses older software, stick with JPG.

---

## Pro Tips

*   **Batch process:** Select multiple images at once to save time.
*   **Check the total:** Add up all attachment sizes before hitting send.
*   **Privacy first:** Our tools run in your browser — your photos never leave your device.

QR codes are everywhere in 2026 — restaurant menus, business cards, product packaging, event tickets, and posters. They bridge the physical and digital worlds with a single scan.

## What Can a QR Code Link To?

| Use Case | What to Encode | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Card** | Your website URL | \`https://yoursite.com\` |
| **Restaurant Menu** | PDF or page link | \`https://menu.yoursite.com\` |

## How to Create a Custom QR Code

Our [QR Code Generator](/qr-code-generator) lets you create branded QR codes with custom colors and logos — for free.

### Step 1: Enter Your Content
Type or paste the URL, text, or WiFi credentials you want to encode.

### Step 2: Customize Colors
*   **Foreground:** Match your brand color (e.g., your logo's hex code).
*   **Background:** White works best for printing, but you can use any light color.
*   **Tip:** Ensure high contrast between foreground and background for reliable scanning.

### Step 3: Add Your Logo
Upload your company logo as a PNG. It gets placed in the center of the QR code. QR codes have built-in error correction, so the logo doesn't break the scan.

### Step 4: Download
Choose your resolution (up to 1024px for print quality) and download as a high-res PNG.

---

## Design Best Practices

1.  **Size matters:** For business cards, the QR code should be at least **2cm x 2cm** (0.8 inches). Smaller codes are hard to scan.
2.  **Test before printing:** Always scan your QR code with at least 2 different phones before sending it to the printer.
3.  **Don't invert colors:** Dark foreground on light background. Never the other way around — most scanners struggle with inverted codes.
4.  **Add a CTA:** Print "Scan me" or "Visit our site" next to the code. People scan 30% more often when prompted.
5.  **Use a short URL:** Long URLs create dense, harder-to-scan patterns. Use a link shortener if needed.

---

## QR Codes on Business Cards

The modern business card includes:
*   Your name, title, and company
*   A QR code linking to your **digital portfolio or LinkedIn**
*   A clean design with plenty of whitespace

This way, someone can scan the card instead of manually typing your URL. It's faster and prevents typos.

Choosing the right image format can make or break your website's speed, your social media quality, or your print output. Here's the definitive 2026 comparison.

## The Format Showdown

| Feature | JPEG | PNG | WebP | AVIF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compression** | Lossy | Lossless | Both | Both |
| **Transparency** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Animation** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

| **Browser Support** | 100% | 100% | 97% | 93% |
| **Best For** | Photos | Logos/Icons | Web images | Cutting edge |

---

## JPEG — The Reliable Veteran

**Use when:** You need maximum compatibility and the image is a photo.

*   ✅ Supported literally everywhere (email, social media, printers).
*   ✅ Good compression for photographs.
*   ❌ No transparency support.
*   ❌ Quality degrades each time you re-save.

**Verdict:** Still the safest choice for email attachments and situations where you don't control the viewer.

---

## PNG — The Quality King

**Use when:** You need transparency or pixel-perfect graphics.

*   ✅ Lossless — never loses quality.
*   ✅ Supports transparency (alpha channel).
*   ❌ File sizes are 5-10x larger than JPEG for photos.
*   ❌ Overkill for photographs.

**Verdict:** Perfect for logos, icons, screenshots, and any graphic with text.

---

## WebP — The Modern Standard

**Use when:** You're building a website or sharing images online.

*   ✅ 25-34% smaller than JPEG at equal quality.
*   ✅ Supports transparency AND animation.
*   ✅ 97% browser support in 2026.
*   ❌ Some older software can't open it.

**Verdict:** The best all-around format for the web in 2026. If you're not using WebP on your website, you're leaving performance on the table.

---

## AVIF — The Future

**Use when:** You want the absolute smallest file sizes and your audience uses modern browsers.

*   ✅ 50% smaller than JPEG at equal quality.
*   ✅ Supports HDR, wide color gamut, and transparency.
*   ❌ Slower to encode (takes more CPU).
*   ❌ 93% browser support — still gaps on older devices.

**Verdict:** Technically superior to WebP, but not yet universally supported. Use it if you can serve fallbacks.

---

## Which Format Should You Pick?

| Scenario | Recommended Format |
| :--- | :--- |
| Website hero images | **WebP** (with JPEG fallback) |
| Logo or icon | **PNG** or **SVG** |
| Email attachment | **JPEG** |
| Social media post | **JPEG** or **PNG** |
| E-commerce product photo | **WebP** |
| Cutting-edge web app | **AVIF** (with WebP fallback) |
| Print (flyer, poster) | **PNG** or **TIFF** |

## Convert Between Formats Instantly

Social media platforms update their image specs constantly. Uploading the wrong size means your photos get cropped awkwardly, compressed to mush, or hidden by UI overlays. This guide covers every major platform's requirements for 2026.

## Instagram Image Sizes 2026

| Post Type | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Feed Post (Square)** | 1080 x 1080 px | 1:1 |
| **Feed Post (Portrait)** | 1080 x 1350 px | 4:5 |
| **Feed Post (Landscape)** | 1080 x 566 px | 1.91:1 |
| **Story / Reel** | 1080 x 1920 px | 9:16 |
| **Profile Picture** | 320 x 320 px | 1:1 |

**Pro tip:** Always use the 4:5 portrait format for feed posts. It takes up 23% more screen space than a square, boosting engagement.

| Content Type | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Video** | 1080 x 1920 px | 9:16 |
| **Profile Photo** | 200 x 200 px | 1:1 |

TikTok is video-first, but thumbnail quality matters. Ensure your first frame is clear at 1080x1920.

---

## X (Twitter) Image Sizes

| Content Type | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **In-Stream Photo** | 1600 x 900 px | 16:9 |
| **Header Banner** | 1500 x 500 px | 3:1 |
| **Profile Picture** | 400 x 400 px | 1:1 |

Images wider than 16:9 get cropped. Test your thumbnail with our [Image Compare Tool](/compare-images-online) to see how it will look before and after cropping.

---

## LinkedIn Image Sizes

| Content Type | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Post Image** | 1200 x 627 px | 1.91:1 |
| **Banner** | 1584 x 396 px | 4:1 |
| **Profile Picture** | 400 x 400 px | 1:1 |

LinkedIn compresses heavily. Upload at maximum quality to compensate.

Whether you are checking compression quality, comparing photo edits, or reviewing design iterations, seeing two images side by side is essential. Our free Image Compare tool makes this effortless.

## Why Compare Images?

Image comparison is useful for:
*   **Compression Quality Checks:** Did your JPEG compression lose too much detail? Slide between the original and compressed version to find out.
*   **Photo Editing Reviews:** Compare before/after versions of your retouching work.
*   **Design Feedback:** Show clients two versions of a logo or layout.
*   **AI Upscaling Verification:** See if the AI actually improved your image or just made it blurry.
*   **Format Comparison:** Does WebP look as good as the original PNG? Compare them pixel-by-pixel.

---

## 3 Comparison Modes

Our tool offers three distinct viewing modes:

### 1. Slider Mode (Default)
A vertical line divides the two images. Drag it left or right to reveal each version. This is the most intuitive mode and works great for:
*   Before/after photography edits
*   Compression quality comparisons
*   Color correction checks

### 2. Side-by-Side Mode
Both images displayed next to each other at equal size. Best for:
*   Comparing two completely different images
*   Design A/B testing
*   Quick visual scanning

### 3. Overlay Mode
One image overlays the other with adjustable opacity. Perfect for:
*   Pixel-level alignment checks
*   Spotting subtle differences
*   Verifying image dimensions match

---

## How to Use the Image Compare Tool

1.  Go to the [Image Compare Tool](/tool/image-compare).
2.  **Upload your first image** (the "Before" or "Original").
3.  **Upload the second image** (the "After" or "Modified").
4.  **Choose your mode:** Slider, Side-by-Side, or Overlay.
5.  **Drag the slider** or adjust the opacity to compare.
6.  **Swap images** with one click if they are in the wrong order.

## Real-World Workflow Example

Here is a common workflow for web developers optimizing site images:

1.  Take your original PNG hero image.
2.  Compress it with our [WebP Converter](/tool/compress).
3.  Open both images in the [Image Compare Tool](/compare-images-online).
4.  Use Slider Mode to verify the compressed version looks identical.
5.  Only then replace the original on your site.

This ensures you never ship a degraded image to production.
